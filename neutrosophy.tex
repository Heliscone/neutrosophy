\section{Introduction}
The question begins, which is, ``Where do we begin?" But perhaps a better question would be to ask, ``What is the definition of Neutrosophy?" To know this, perhaps we should beg the question, "Who invented Neutrosophy?" But then we would need to know the origins and shenanigans of this individual, so perhaps it is better to wonder, ``Why would anyone care about Neutrosophy?" Better yet, why ask a why, when we could ask, ``How is Neutrosophy?" Equivalently, how blue was the orange you ate today?

Professor Florentin Smarandache is, to put it simply, a polymath. Smarandache has been a force to be reckoned with all of his life, working his way up from being honorably discharged as an artillery soldier in the Romanian military to creating a theory of physics contradictory to Einstein's relativity. Now, after a stint of teaching in Morocco, he has been exiled from Romania to the United States, where he is the chair of the mathematics department at the University of New Mexico's Gallup campus.
