\section{Introduction}
The question begins, which is, "Where do we begin?" But perhaps a better question would be to ask, "What is the definition of Neutrosophy?" To know this, perhaps we should beg the question, "Who invented Neutrosophy?" But then we would need to know the origins and shenanigans of this individual, so perhaps it is better to wonder, "Why would anyone care about Neutrosophy?" Better yet, why ask a why, when we could ask, "How is Neutrosophy?" By the way, how blue was the orange you ate today?
